# Access

# Usage

The player must repeat the order of the button's blink and then try to repeat the sequence. Each level the sequence increases making the game harder.


# What I Learned

A better understanding of the jQuery library and how it makes easier things like: DOM Manipulators, Event Listeners, Higher Order Functions, Callbacks, OOP and website responsiveness/behaviour using JavaScript.
